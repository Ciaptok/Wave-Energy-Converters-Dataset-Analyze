# Wave Energy Converters Dataset Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing and modeling data from wave energy converters, which generate renewable energy through ocean wave movements. By leveraging spatial and energy output data, we aim to develop predictive models that can enhance the efficiency and placement of these converters.

## Project Objectives

The primary objective of this analysis is to develop a predictive model that estimates the **total generated energy (`power_all`)** based on the following inputs:
- **Spatial Coordinates** (`X1`-`X16`, `Y1`-`Y16`): Positioning of each wave energy converter.
- **Individual Power Outputs** (`P1`-`P16`): Power generated by each converter.

Through this model, we intend to enable improved planning and optimized positioning of converters for maximum energy efficiency.

## Dataset Description

The dataset includes measurements across multiple columns, structured as follows:

- **Coordinates**:
    - `X1`-`X16`: X-coordinates of each wave energy converter.
    - `Y1`-`Y16`: Y-coordinates of each wave energy converter.
- **Energy Output per Converter**:
    - `P1`-`P16`: Amount of energy generated by each converter individually.
- **Total Generated Energy**:
    - `power_all`: Total energy generated by all converters combined.

Each row represents a unique set of measurements across these attributes.

## Analysis Approach

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
    - Handle missing values, normalize or standardize the data if needed, and prepare the dataset for modeling.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
    - Visualize relationships between coordinates, individual power outputs, and the total generated energy.
    - Examine spatial patterns to understand the impact of placement on energy output.

3. **Modeling**:
    - Develop a regression model to predict `power_all` using the individual power outputs and spatial coordinates.
    - Experiment with multiple algorithms to identify the model with the best performance.

4. **Evaluation**:
    - Assess model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
    - Analyze feature importance to understand the primary factors contributing to energy output.

5. **Optimization Insights**:
    - Based on the model, provide insights on optimal converter placement to maximize energy production.
